//CSS Selector and XPath
//We will identify the elemnet using locotors.
//cy.get(Locator)-by using this we can identify the element.

//CSS selector:
//1. tag- id 
//2. tag- class
//3. tag- attribute
//4. tag- class attribute. (tag is optional with locotors)
//5. To use Xpath, we need to add xpath plugin by using
//npm install -D cypress-xpath 
//CSS is default and only loctor cypress supports.
